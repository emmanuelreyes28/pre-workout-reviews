## The Pre-Workout Insider

Here, you can discover new pre-workout products and share your own reviews based on your personal experiences. We provide detailed information about each pre-workout, including its benefits, caffeine content, and whether it features an open label or proprietary blend. Make informed decisions and find the perfect pre-workout to enhance your fitness journey.

## How It Was Built

I used React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS alongside MongoDB Atlas to store product information.

## What I Learned

These concepts I already knew but it was my first time using them with Next.js which made it extremely easy to implement!

- Server side rendering
- API routes
- Routes and Dynamic Routing
- Database models

## How Can I Make It Better?

- Filter function to search for pre-workouts that fall into specific categories such as caffeine content, labeling, ratings and brand.
- Registration, log-in and user profile to make reviews more legitimate and track users' reviews
- Product Form for users to submit pre-workouts that may not already be listed in the site

## Run the project
